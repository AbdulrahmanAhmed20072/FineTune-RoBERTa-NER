# FineTune-RoBERTa-NER
This project fine-tunes RoBERTa for Named Entity Recognition (NER) using LoRA and BitsAndBytes quantization. It processes text data, tokenizes sentences, applies efficient fine-tuning techniques, and trains a Transformer model to recognize entity types with optimized memory usage.
